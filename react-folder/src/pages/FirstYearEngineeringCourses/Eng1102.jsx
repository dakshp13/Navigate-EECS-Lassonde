                <h3>Pre-Enrollment Advice</h3>
                <p> Very Similar to the description and Pre-Enrollment advice in ENG 1101, even though the work is not hard, just make sure you are on top
                    of things so this course can actually be used as a "GPA Booster". Also most of the times there is a main group project and I would just try to 
                    get most of the work done right away without reliance on group members

                <h3>Resources I highly recommend for success in this course</h3>
                <h3>For this course I will say the best resources are just the powerpoints given on the course site by professors, as they are the best 
                    bet in terms of studying for the tests/quizzes throughout the course.

                <p>
                   Congrats your GPA is now a complete Grade Point Higher because you did all the work!!!
