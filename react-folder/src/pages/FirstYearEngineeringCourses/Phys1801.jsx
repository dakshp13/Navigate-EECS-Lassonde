                <h3>Pre-Enrollment Advice</h3>
                <p> This course is another Physics course that has a classroom and lab component, and focuses on a different side of Physics compared to 
                    PHYS1800, where its more about Electric and Magnetics Forces this time around.

                            : This playlist that I recommended for PHYS1800 can also be used again, however most of the material for PHYS1801 is found 
                            at the end of the playlist. Still very good for understanding core concepts

                         </a>
                            : Another Khan Academy tool that helped with some core concepts during this course, expecially with things like Faraday's and Lenz Law 
                            and other Magnetics Laws. Personally, some of these Laws can be unintuitive at times but the more practice will help.

                <p>
                   Overall, again this course is not that bad and for most people its doable as it focuses on just giving Physics formulas and solving word problems. However, 
                   despite it seeming useless for Software Engineering, in terms of the degree itself it actually isn't. I would recommend keeping the knowledge and notes from this course 
                   as it will help you a lot in Second Year Physics Courses and EECS2200 as well which is taken in the Software Engineering Stream.
