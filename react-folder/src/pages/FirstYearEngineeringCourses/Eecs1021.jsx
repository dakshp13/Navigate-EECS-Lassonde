                <h3>Pre-Enrollment Advice</h3>
                <p>This course here is a very core course for everyone going into Software and Computer Engineering. Before going
                    into university you are assumed to have no programming experience. Since with EECS 1011 you learn the fundamentals
                    of programming with MATLAB, its time to take it up a notch and use Java. In this course you will learn core Java
                    concepts and basic OOP. It is best that before the course you watch a Java Tutorial and do some practice and you will
                    find yourself easily getting through this course. Furthermore, base on some professors, you may do self-learning however, it is important
                    to make sure you actually fully understand the material so that you have good fundamentals in Java. This will be very important in your 2nd Year.

                            : This Intro to Java Youtube PLaylist is great with a lot of concepts in short videos. It also
                            has many practice questions that I recommend, which will help better grasp core Programming and Java Concepts.

                <h3>After Completing the Course</h3>
                <p>
                    This Course is very fundamental to EECS programs at York and thus it is important
                    to learn it well. To finalize the course the final project is using Java to work with an
                    Arduino board. I also recommend doing another mini project with java skills (like creating a mini-game or a simple tic-tac-toe)
