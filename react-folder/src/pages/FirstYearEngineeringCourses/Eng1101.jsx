                <h3>Pre-Enrollment Advice</h3>
                <p> This course is one of the non-technical courses taught in first-year engineering, and is sometimes known as a "GPA Booster". Due to this 
                    there is not much in terms of resources I can offer since most people are not going to use them anyways. However don't slack off completely,
                    as there are still assignment and work to be done in order to get a good grade.

                            : Even though most people don't need external resources to do good in this class, I would say if you wanted to learn some more
                            take a look at stuff on PEO websites and documents, as it might help in later courses (ENG 3000 in your third year)
