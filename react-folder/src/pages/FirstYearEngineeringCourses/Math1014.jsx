                <p> Some say this is the hardest course of first-year and for most it will be one of the hardest for sure. For most its the first introduction to 
                    various integration techniques in different word problems (and even includes some physics concepts), as well as evaluating Series and Sequences.

                            Organic Chem Tutor Playlist: Calculus Playlist
                         </a>
                            : Once again Organic Chem Tutor is here to save the day. A complete playlist on this topics with so many examples. There will be many times 
                            where you don't understand certain topics in lectures, and I recommend going to one of the videos in this playlist that explains it. Also try to 
                            do the practice problems in the videos as well, they help a lot ! (Most of the content related to Calc 2 is at the bottom of the playlist while other Calc 1 
                            concepts are at the top)

                         </a>
                            : Now this Youtuber Playlist is specifically focused on Integration with Work and HydroStatic Force which is a part of MATH 1014, and I used this playlist a lot 
                            for helping me understand that topic. Normally that topic is difficult to most people, but this playlist helps in understanding it a lot. Furthermore, don't just limit yourself 
                            to this playlist, because this channel is full of various different videos and other playlist covering so many concepts of MATH 1014.

                            : Another amazing instructor for MATH 1014. This playlist is the one with many different integration examples, however 
                            browse through his whole channel and you will see various videos that will help in different concepts in Calc 2

                            : Khan Academy is also very good in helping with various topics covered in MATH 1014, Here I have linked the website that has a list of topics that 
                            you can go through, and even some practice questions (quiz like material) to use. However, also try to see if they are on youtube and maybe find some good 
                            videos there as well.
