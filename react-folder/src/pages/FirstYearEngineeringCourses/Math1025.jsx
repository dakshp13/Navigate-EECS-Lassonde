                <h3>Pre-Enrollment Advice</h3>
                <p> One of the courses that has very mixed reviews in terms of difficulties, however overall its not that bad. The mathematical solving can be perfected 
                    with lots of practice, however some proofs tend to be a little hard and unintuitive.

                            : This playlist is my first recommendation for MATH 1025, as all the topics are explained very well. Once again they are split into 
                            individual videos, so whenever you don't understand anything in the lectures, I recommend coming here first as its the best choice. There are 
                            many practice problems that are solved in the videos and thats the best way to learn in this course
                        </p>

                            Khan Academy: Linear Algebra
                         </a>
                            : Khan Academy is also a really good choice for this course because they also have everything split up into different sections for your learning however, 
                            they have these practice multiple choice quizzes that were very useful for me because when I took MATH 1025 a good amount of the test had similar multiple choice 
                            questions, and I doubt the department is going to change that anytime soon.

                <p>
                   In terms of first year this course material will not really come back, however when you get to third and fourth year and are 
                   in the big-data stream some of the Machine Learning courses will use these linear algerba concepts. Even if you are not in Big Data Stream, but 
                   are still interested in Machine Learning via the industry or research/academia linear algebra is a core skill to have.
