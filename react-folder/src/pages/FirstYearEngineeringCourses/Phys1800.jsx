                <h3>Pre-Enrollment Advice</h3>
                <p> This course is the first Physics course that is taken in first semester of first year. The first half of the course is very similar to 
                    SPH4U in Ontario High Schools. The Second half starts on more newer topics like Rotational Physics and Torque which are some of the newer concepts. 
                    This is also one of the courses with a lab for doing hands on work.

                            Organic Chem Tutor : Physics Playlist
                         </a>
                            : Yes the Organic Chem Tutor does a lot more than just Chemistry and even has this amazing playlist on Physics. The first part is 
                            really helpful for this course and the second part is more helpful for PHYS1801 which is the next course. Overall this is the only real resource that I used 
                            during the course however feel free to leave a review for more resources that I can add to this page.

                <p>
                   This course isn't the hardest to complete however in terms of Software Engineering, has concepts that you will probably never used again. Even if you go to a more 
                   hardware role in life, the content of this course probably won't ever come back. However still need to get through this course to take PHYS1801, which has more reliability on it
