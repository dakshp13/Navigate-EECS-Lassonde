                <h3>Pre-Enrollment Advice</h3>
                <p> This course is very similar to Grade 12 High School Calculus which is MCV4U. However there might be one new thing which 
                    is simply an intro to integrals and just a preview of many things to come in the next semester and in later years. However they still teach this course 
                    assuming you know nothing so this course is a MUST PAY ATTENTION and NO MESSING AROUND Class, as this fundamental knowledge will help a lot 
                    in later semesters and later years.

                            : The Simple Greatest thing to exist for any engineering or math major. This playlist has it all. Covers all the concepts of 
                            limits and derivatives that you will need to be successful in MATH 1013. Since the prof's teaching may not suite you, If you do not understand anything
                            I would strongly recommend going to this playlist first.

                            : Now this Youtuber Playlist will come more in handy in MATH 1014 when you are learning about integrals however, it is still useful during this course 
                            For me he doesn't have a single playlist but simple put his name and whatever topic you need to learn on youtube and it will come up. Personally, he taught me 
                            epsilon-delta proofs in such a easy way that I never forgot. Highly Recommend.

                            : Another amazing instructor who will again come in handy in MATH 1014, however is still very useful for MATH 1013 material. If you are struggling with
                            limits in calc then he has so many videos walking through various examples. Also really good for epsilon-delta proofs as well.

                <p>
                   In terms of projects there is nothing, but I recommend understanding all the material properly as in a few weeks you will 
                   move on to learning Calc 2 (MATH 1014) and that will be completely new material and one of the hardest/most important courses in 
                   first year.
