                <h3>Pre-Enrollment Advice</h3>
                <p> Now this course is a very weird course. I wouldn't say its the hardest in terms of content, however for most people coming from high school, they have never 
                    take any sort of Discrete Math before, and due to that since MATH 1028 covers very new topics it could be challenging. However, although sometimes with the rigorous proofs 
                    you may get bored, make sure to pay attention, because this is a very important course for future years.

                            Dr. Trefor Bazett: Discrete Math Playlist
                         </a>
                            : This playlist is highly recommended by me. In terms of the actual class lectures there will be many times where you may not understand things due to 
                            it being very new concepts or it being unintuitive. Either way, this playlist covers various topics in Discrete Math that are very helpful.

                            : Another very useful resource to go to for studying this course as there are various videos that help you understand key topics.

                            Organic Chem Tutor: Mathematical Induction
                         </a>
                            : Alright so this one is not a playlist or anything but is instead just one 20 min video. However it is so clear and good and teaches you 
                            Induction in an amazing way. Induction is used in so many courses in Comp Sci and SWE, and espacially in this course Induction isn't always taught the best. 
                            However, this video is a highly recommended watch when going into the Induction topic and make your life easier.

                   For this course this is material that will be there throughout your whole undergrad experience. You will take courses like MATH 1090 and 
                   (EECS 2001 if you are in the Computer Science Stream) that will build on the knowledge from this course. And you are not done yet as other courses like 
                   EECS 2101 and EECS 3101 which are (Data Structures and Algorithms courses that are important for interviews) will also build on this course espacially in 
                   the Induction concept.
