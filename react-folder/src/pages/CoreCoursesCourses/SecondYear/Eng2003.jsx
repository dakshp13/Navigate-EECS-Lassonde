                <h3>Pre-Enrollment Advice</h3>
                <p> This is another non-technical ENG course however again its offered in two different ways. One is something called C4 where you work on a project 
                    throughout the whole semester with students from different majors and practice things like scrum, agile and sprints which are key project management concepts. The 
                    other way is a normal Eng 2003 section where they have you working on networking, communication and other skills. Overall nothing to difficult however, regardless of which 
                    option you choose or whether they teach you this or not, it is important that during this time you learn how to build a good resume and linkedin. Both will 
                    be very valuable in your life, as this is the time when you are finishing up 2nd year and thinking about internships or jobs in your field or even student research. Regardless, 
                    knowing how to properly set-up your resume in a clean and professional way is important as well as your linkedin.
