                <h3>Pre-Enrollment Advice</h3>
                <p> Now this is a course that is only specific to the software engineering stream and no other program takes it. Also this course can be a bit weird. So I will 
                    spend a decent amount of time in the Pre-Enrollment Advice here. Firstly, this may vary based on different professor's however what I will state here is the 
                    worst case scenario on how the course will be run so you can prepare in advance. In general this course has you working in groups with others to build a full-stack 
                    application (website or app). Firstly, make sure that you yourself have all the skills to do the project because sometimes group members don't do the work. Secondly, this project 
                    in general if you have experience with full stack development is fairly easy, however the problem is that most people don't and in this class they sometimes don't actuall teach full-stack development.
                    Here is the jist, the course is labelled as you taking all the skills you have learned in undergrad so far and building a project, but the thing is the only skill you have learned so far 
                    is some OOP and that's it, since this is only a second year course, you are still in the process of developing the skills. In the lectures they teach various things that are very important in terms 
                    of being a software engineering such as GitHub & Version Control, Agile Methods, Testing, Documentations. However they don't actually teach the programming. This sometimes becomes and issue and 
                    can cause a lot of stress. However in my experience it is easy to resolve. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    TL;DR : Basically before the course (or even during the course) go to one of the websites here and learn basic full stack development on how to connect 
                    a frontend - backend - database, and you will easily succeed in the course. Also don't copy the code from the tutorial for your project, just learn from there.

                            : I am linking the whole channel here, because a lot of videos are spread across various playlists, however just look at or search for full-stack projects by this channel. I recommend 
                            watching a short one (under 2 or 3 hours), and something of a basic concept to begin with, as they will teach the skills very well, so that you can later use them to develop your project with 
                            EECS 2311. Also note that in this course you can use any programming language you want, and this channel has tutorials for full-stack development for most of those languages that are popular.

                         In General: There are many resources, and its hard to pinpoint a few since your group can be using any tech-stack and programming languages. However whatever you choose to use, 
                         go on youtube and look at a simple tutorial of someone building a website or CRUD app, so that you can learn full-stack development and succeed. Also start from the beginning, otherwise 
                         if you fall behind, you might have some issues and things can get stressed.

                <p>
                   This course is very important. A lot of people will do full-stack development and this course is the starting point. Also, you will use these skills, in later 
                   courses as well. Even if you are not working full-stack chances are you will be working with API's or Agile at some point in your life so make sure to understand the 
                   course content here properly. Last thing and a very important thing, This course teaches GitHub and Version Control very well. This skill is insanely important, yet 
                   for some reason is not taught in many schools. In our stream they are giving labs and practice on version control so it is really important to take advantage of that.
