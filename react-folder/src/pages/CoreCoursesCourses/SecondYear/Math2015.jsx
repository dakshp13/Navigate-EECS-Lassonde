                <h3>Pre-Enrollment Advice</h3>
                <p> Alright so this course is basically Calc 3. Normally when you start second year and onwards, most people start to pay a lot of attention to 
                    EECS courses and kind of slack of on the others. Except this one. Because this course is your last dance at calculus and once you finish you 
                    don't have Calc 4 to take. Before starting this make sure you properly understand the core concepts in MATH 1014 and MATH 1013 as those same concepts 
                    will be applied to harder problems.

                            : This playlist has hundred plus videos diving into all the core concepts of MATH 2015, and has great examples for learning. The best way 
                            to get good at this course is by doing a bunch of practice and this will help a lot. This is the link to the youtube playlist, however, going

                            Professor Leonard: Calculus 3
                         </a>
                            : This playlist is basically the exact same as per content as you will learn most likely in your own class. The order may be different 
                            however, each video in this playlist has a title so you can go directly there. However since this playlist are Professor Leonard's own lectures
                            they are longer videos, however, still worth the watch to really understand certain topics.
