                <h3>Pre-Enrollment Advice</h3>
                <p> This course is the secondary to EECS 1028 where you learn more discrete math and start preparing for the 
                    theory perspective of your future algorithms classes. Overall as long as you understand the core concepts in 
                    EECS 1028 about discrete math, (predicate logic, functions, relations, sets, induction, etc), then this course should not be much of a problem.

                            Organic Chem Tutor: Mathematical Induction
                         </a>
                            : Overall, I didn't use much external resources for this course, as lecture material was enough, however this youtube video 
                            that is also in my MATH 1028 page is elite for easily learning Mathematical Induction which you will probably need in future courses and 
                            for sure will need to succeed in this course.

                <p>
                   Main takeaways from this course are induction and also time complexity if your prof teaches, however its not mandatory. But these 
                   two concepts and also some other intro algorithms and proving them (merge sort, binary search) are crucial as they will help in 
                   future algorithms courses.
