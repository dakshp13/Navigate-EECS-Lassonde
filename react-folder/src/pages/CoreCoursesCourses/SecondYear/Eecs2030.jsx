                <h3>Pre-Enrollment Advice</h3>
                <p> This course is normally take in the first semester of your second year and is the start to your programming career. In terms of 
                    what you should know before this course is knowing the fundamentals of your Java Programming skills, so that when you start using them 
                    in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts it will be smooth. You may get lucky and get a prof that teaches the fundamentals as a review in the 
                    beginning of the course, however I wouldn't rely on just luck and would instead make sure I am comfortable with basic Java beforehand.

                         </a>
                            : In this course I had it with Prof. Jackie Wang and he has a great website with all the content available for all the courses he 
                            teaches. In this case I never used external resources because this site itself was very good. If you are using this as an external resource 
                            because you are not in his section, I would recommend going to the latest version of EECS 2030 on his webpage and finding the lecture slides or 
                            notes from the topic you need. The site is very organized so you can easily find it.

                <h3>After Completing the Course</h3>
                <p>
                   I really recommend ensuring you know all of the key-aspects from this course as when you get into later courses your Java 
                   skills that you learned from here will be at test, as well as your OOP fundamentals in future third year courses. In terms of projects 
                   there are plenty you can do and normally revolve around management systems (Airline Management, Hotel Management, School Management), as this 
                   is a great way to practice your OOP skills. If you are confused by what I mean here, just search up sample OOP projects and you will get a ton of them
                   with this "management system" idea.
