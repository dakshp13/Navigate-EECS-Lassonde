                <h3>Pre-Enrollment Advice</h3>
                <p> This course a lot of people compare to PHYS 1801 since both are Electricity and Magnetism, and also have the similar content. However, 
                    the difference is that this is basically Calc-Based Physics. In PHYS 1801 you were given the formulas and had to plug in values. Here you actually 
                    sometimes will have to derive formulas using calculus knowledge. It may seem hard however is still a doable course. In terms of knowledge beforehand 
                    just ensure you have good integration skills from MATH 1014.

                            : A Very good playlist for understanding some of the core physics derivation you will do with integrals and other 
                            calculus concepts in PHYS 2020. Has a range of videos that explain these important topics and if you are stuck I would 
                            recommend checking here first.

                <p>
                   In the Software Engineering stream since we are getting a B.ENG Degree, some of these Physics courses are mandatory, however, 
                   they don't come up to often in your career or even later studies. So congrats you are now finished with your Physics Courses.
