                <h3>Pre-Enrollment Advice</h3>
                <p> This course is for all engineers and normally is straight-forward, or atleast people don't talk about it much 
                    since there are other harder courses in second year. In terms, of previous knowledge not much is required and most 
                    of the things will be taught to you during the class.

                            : MATH 2930 doesn't require insane amounts of studying atleast compared to other courses, and mostly is doable with lecture material,
                            however if you ever get stuck this is the playlist to go for, as it covers most topics with examples in seperate videos.

                <h3>After Completing the Course</h3>
                <p>
                   This course might comeback later on, if you choose the Big Data Stream, since many Machine Learning concepts do revolve around 
                   this course content, however that will be in 4th year probably so the best bet is to just understand the concept, so when its time to 
                   review you easily can gain the information back. Also you might practice some R or Python programming for Stats and Probability, so those 
                   skills might come in handy later on as well.
