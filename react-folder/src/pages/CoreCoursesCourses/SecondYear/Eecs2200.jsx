                <p> In this course mostly everything that needs to be known is taught from scratch since it's an intro course for Electrical Engineering's 
                    however, they make people in the Software Engineering stream also take it as well.

                            : I had the course with this prof and we basically learned by watching these videos, and for my experience they were pretty good. So if 
                            you are in his class you can just watch those, otherwise if you are stuck on a specific topic I would go to this playlist and find a video.

                   Normally, when you see and EECS course it probably has some degree of usage in your career, however this one for software engineer's is not the same.
                   I would say if you are trying to actually get a role related to Software Engineering, you will probably not use anything from this course again, unless 
                   you somehow switch to working with circuit design and hardware.
