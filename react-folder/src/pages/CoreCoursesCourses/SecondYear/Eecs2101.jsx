                <h3>Pre-Enrollment Advice</h3>
                <p> Before you get into this course there is nothing in terms of specific content you need to know, as long as you are good with your skills in 
                    Java or can understand Pseudo Code, and have some good discrete math knowledge, you will be fine. However, it is important to know that this course 
                    and EECS 3101 (The course after this) are VERY important to your career. When you do a software engineering interview or prepare via leetcode you get 
                    asked questions about Data Structures & Algorithms. That is exactly what these two courses cover. Hence it is very important to pay attention to the core concepts 
                    in the course and exactly learn.

                            : In this course I had it with Prof. Jackie Wang and he has a great website with all the content available for all the courses he 
                            teaches. If you do not have it with him, you can still go to his website, check the latest version of EECS 2101 he has taught and go over 
                            his iPad Notes, Lecture Videos, Slides, and even the practice problems (mostly with solutions) to better practice you skills.

                            Abdul Bari: Algorithms + DSA Playlist
                         </a>
                            : Abdul Bari is a very well known youtube prof, for the DSA Courses and you will see his videos in both EECS 2101 and EECS 3101 very useful. This playlist 
                            has most of the content for both courses seperated into videos, so you can go straight to the topic you need. Sometimes a topic you need may not be in this playlist, however 
                            still somewhere on youtube by Abdul Bari, so in that case just search up his name with the topic you need to see if it exists. This resource is amazing 
                            for learning the core concepts of DSA.

                            : This youtube channel is a great way to start getting into prep for software engineering interviews with the skills you are learning 
                            in this course. What I have linked here is his playlist where he goes over various DSA problems with great explanations. His solutions are in 
                            Python but if you are more familiar with Java you can just still watch the video and implement it in a different language. I would also recommend 
                            going to NeetCode's website on google with an easy NeetCode Google Search, that has various different sets of problems in an organized manner with solutions 
                            to help you practice for you labs/test and interviews.

                            : Another very good resource that is useful for understanding core DSA concepts. The nice this about this is they also have a quix per 
                            each major section where you can test your knowledge. Most of the time in EECS 2101 there is atleast one written test, and a good way to 
                            help in your study alongside all the course material is using the quizzes from here.

                            Coding Bat: Recursion
                         </a>
                            : In this resource it is a website that also has a bunch of programming and DSA questions. I would recommend using the 
                            Recursion-1 and Recursion-2 questions to really practice recursion. The reason for this is that recursion is a very important 
                            programming topic and you will be introduced to it, in this course. However, when you are first introduced to it, for most people it is very 
                            hard to follow. The best way to get good at it is simply just studying different recursive algorithms and also practice recursive questions, as 
                            much as you can.

                <h3>After Completing the Course</h3>
                <p>
                   If you have the time go to LeetCode or NeetCode or any other programming interview practice websites and practice your skills. This course is not the end all, since 
                   you still have EECS 3101 to go, hence you will not be able to understand all the questions, but do the ones for the concepts that you have covered so far in EECS 2101. I also recommend 
                   taking EECS 2101 and EECS 3101 and soon as possible, so that you can start preparing and taking Software Engineering interviews for Co-op, internships or even part-time jobs.
