                <h3>Pre-Enrollment Advice</h3>
                <p> So this is basically just a one credit lab course, as you go to the lab for 3 hours a week and do some hands-on practice
                    for some PHYS 2020 concepts you learned. In terms of pre-enrollment, I would advise to carefully read the lab manual before 
                    every lab because it will make your 3 hours easier.

                        <p>
                            For this course there are no resources needed. Simply, the lab manuals and pre-lab videos should be good enough. Also, 
                            it's a good idea to go over the concepts from PHYS 2020 that are used before your labs, as that will help as well.

                <h3>After Completing the Course</h3>
                <p>
                   In the Software Engineering stream since we are getting a B.ENG Degree, some of these Physics courses are mandatory, however, 
                   they don't come up to often in your career or even later studies. So congrats you are now finished with your Physics Courses.
