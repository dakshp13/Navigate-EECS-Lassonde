                <h3>Pre-Enrollment Advice</h3>
                <p> This just like many ENG courses doesn't have much to talk about since it is a non-technical course. However, before you just never attend a lecture 
                    for this class, I suggest you do actually pay attention since this class normally has tests and the economics section can get a little technical. However,
                    most of the grade is from the project management portion, which is a final project and I would recommend getting started early so that you don't get drowned from the work.
                </p>

                       <p>
                            In this course no real resources, since economics is taught at a very basic level and project management is also taught 
                            at a very basic level.

                <h3>After Completing the Course</h3>
                <p>
                   For the most part, you don't have to do much after this class, however if for some reason you are applying to Project Management jobs 
                   since that is a growing role in tech, the final project in this course may be useful to display to your employers
