            <h1>About and Extra Info Page</h1>
            <p id="Intro">
                Welcome to a page I created for Software Engineering Students at York University's Lassonde School of Engineering.
                In this site you will find all the courses you take through your undergrad degree, plus courses you take if you pursue
                the big data stream. Note that this page doesn't talk much about the contents of the courses or my opinion on the difficulty and course or 
                and recommendations of professors. This is simply because you can find this information on various different reddit sites 
                and also ratemyprof website. You can also ask upper-years or simply go on google and get this information. Due to this, the website 
                here does not repeat that information much, only states it a little.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p id="Body">
                So my reasons for making this website and the primary usage is two major points.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                1) I talk about pre-enrollment for all the courses, and not only the prerequisites information, however other information, that 
                I feel is necessary. In my opinion the prerequisites are only just a suggestion in terms of, if you don't have those prerequisites, than there is 
                no chance you will succeed in the course. However, it doesn't tell you what you need to know to succeed in the course. One of the things I noticed is that 
                some courses require some extra knowledge before-hand if you really want to succeed (espacially in the upper years), for that reason on every course this webpage 
                goes over the recommendations of what one should know before taking the course to succeed.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                2) A big bulk of each course page is dedicated to some of the best resources to use (external to the ones given by the professor), to succeed in the course. I have 
                done this so you do not spend hours trying to find good resources that align with what you are learning. Going to any course page here will ensure that you get all the 
                recommended resources in one area that you can use to understand core concepts. This webpage started with resources that I found useful, however, the home page allows
                users to leave extra reviews, so if you have any resource you found useful for a course, that I should add, then please feel free to send a review. However note that resources 
                must be free to use, as it should be inclusive to everyone and these resources can be anything from youtube playlists, online practice sites, or textbooks, etc. In my experience sometimes, 
                the class material isn't enough to learn all the concepts and I have spent a lot of time trying to find good resources, and in the process collected them to 
                display here. 
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p id="Conclusion"> 
                I have added the courses related to the software engineering program, however many of these courses overlap with 
                other engineering programs as well as computer science programs. However, some of the courses such as EECS 2311 and EECS 3342 are 
                only for the software engineering stream. For those courses I have added a little more information about the course in general, because a lot of the time 
                software engineering specific courses have less reviews online, because they do not overlap with computer science courses
